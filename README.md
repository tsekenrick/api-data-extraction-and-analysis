# Extra Credit

For this assignment, I will be **tackling pagination** and **incorporating visualizations using** `matplotlib`. These were the obvious choices, because any requests to the IGDB API are automatically paginated, and data visualization is just useful for answering my questions.

**Dealing with pagination** can be found at [In 180] of `homework02a.ipynb`.

**matplotlib Visualizations** can be found at the bottom of `homework02a.ipynb`.
