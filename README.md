# Extracting Data from APIs
This assignment asked us to extract data from an API of our choice, and then perform analysis on it using various Python libraries, including `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`. The API I chose was for the [Video Game Database](https://www.igdb.com/advanced_search).


## Extra Credit
For this assignment, I will be **tackling pagination** and **incorporating visualizations using** `matplotlib`. These were the obvious choices, because any requests to the IGDB API are automatically paginated, and data visualization is just useful for answering my questions.

**Dealing with pagination** can be found at In [180] of `homework02a.ipynb`.

**matplotlib Visualizations** can be found at the bottom of `homework02a.ipynb`.
